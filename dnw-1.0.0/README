================================================================================

This directory contains the Samsung USB bulk-transfer utility source
files.

This utility is intended to download files to a Samsung electronic
device in USB bulk transfer mode, for example a Samsung SNE60 eReader
stopped in the U-Boot by pressing a key at startup on the serial
console and where you entered the `dnw' command.

If you get the source files from version control (eg. svn), you should
first run:

  autoreconf --install

To go back to a clean version control checkout, run:

  ./autoclean

See the file NEWS for a list of major changes in the current release.

See the file INSTALL for compilation and installation instructions.

Usage Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to perform an USB bulk-transfer of a file to a Samsung
device, this one must beforehand be placed in an appropriate state
where it is ready toreceive a file.

On a Linux ARM-based device, this typically involves accessing the
U-Boot bootloader through the serial console and issuing a download
command:

  dnw c0008000 (for the Samsung SNE-60 eReader device, YMMV)

The `dnw' program can then be launched as root with various options (use
--help option or see manpage for details) and at least the name of
the file to transfer:

  sudo dnw kernel.bin (for the Samsung SNE-60 eReader device kernel, again YMMV)

The `dnw' program will automatically load the appropriate `secbulk.ko'
Linux module driver to communicate with the device as required.

Once transfered on the device, a typical usage would be to launch the
kernel or to copy it to non-volatile memory using commands at the U-Boot prompt:

  bootm c0008000 (for launching the Samsung SNE-60 eReader device
                  kernel from memory, again YMMV)
