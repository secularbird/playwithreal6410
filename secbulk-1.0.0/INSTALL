================================================================================

This directory contains the Samsung USB bulk-transfer Linux kernel
driver sources.

In order to obtain a working driver for your Linux kernel, you will
need to compile it. This requires to obtain you kernel sources
(generally packaged as a `linux-devel' package) and a toolchain
(binary utilities and a C compiler).

The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. Type `make' to compile the driver as an external kernel module.

  2. Type `sudo make install' to install the driver as root.

  3. You can remove the driver binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.

  4. You can generate a redistributable package by typing `make dist'.
